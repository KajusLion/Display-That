# ✨ Display That! ✨
Show your items off!

Have you ever wanted to show your friends an item you got, but did not want to drop it or they were too far away? Well no more - with the **Display That!** mod!

**Display That!** adds a very useful feature (when playing with friends or on a server) by allowing players to show off their items in chat. 
Whenever a player types `[item]` in chat, it gets replaced with their held item information. Eg. Player is holding a Diamond sword, says "Hey guys! Look at my sword: [item]", that gets converted to "Hey guys! Look at my sword: [Diamond Sword]".
You can even _hover over_ it so you can see its details and there is even an _icon_ next to it! Here is how it looks:

We also have a feature to show off how many of that item you have in the stack:

# Known bugs

1. The icon won't show up whenever you send the message and the chat is closed when installed with some mods.
   > I don't know how to fix it, if you do please go ahead. Thanks ❤️
